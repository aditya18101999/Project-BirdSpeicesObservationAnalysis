## 📌 Objectives  
- Study **temporal trends** in bird sightings (seasonality, yearly changes).  
- Compare **forest vs. grassland bird species diversity**.  
- Assess the impact of **environmental factors** (temperature, rainfall, habitat type).  
- Evaluate **observer behavior and reporting patterns**.  
- Provide **conservation-focused insights** using data analysis.
